This repository presents a module applying a novel Coverage Path Planning technique, using the 
boustrophedon as source, this new method can create
a route with different properties for each subarea.

android framework or other third-party code. The core features are in 
[./app/src/main/java/boustrophedon](./app/src/main/java/boustrophedon) following a DDD pattern.
